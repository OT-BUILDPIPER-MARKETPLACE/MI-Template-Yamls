## 2. Description of Categories

### 1. License Risk
- **Definition**: Measures the risk associated with the licensing terms of the components used in a project.
- **Explanation**: Components with restrictive or incompatible licenses may cause legal or compliance issues.
  - **Elite**: Minimal number of problematic licenses, ensuring compliance is nearly guaranteed.
  - **High**: Few licensing concerns, manageable with standard precautions.
  - **Medium**: Some potentially problematic licenses, requiring careful review.
  - **Low**: A significant number of license issues, indicating a high risk of non-compliance.

### 2. Vulnerability Risk
- **Definition**: Assesses the potential security vulnerabilities in the components of the project.
- **Explanation**: Vulnerabilities can expose systems to attacks, data breaches, or other security threats.
  - **Elite**: Very few or no vulnerabilities, ensuring strong security.
  - **High**: A small number of vulnerabilities, manageable with timely patching.
  - **Medium**: Moderate number of vulnerabilities, requiring closer monitoring and remediation.
  - **Low**: High vulnerability count, indicating significant exposure to security threats.

### 3. Operational Risk
- **Definition**: Evaluates risks related to the operational effectiveness and maintainability of the components.
- **Explanation**: Components that are outdated, poorly supported, or lack updates can hinder operations.
  - **Elite**: Components are well-maintained and operationally secure.
  - **High**: Minor operational risks, manageable with proper planning.
  - **Medium**: Noticeable operational issues, requiring effort to mitigate.
  - **Low**: Severe operational risks, possibly leading to performance degradation or failure.

### 4. Activity Risk
- **Definition**: Measures the risk based on the activity level of the component’s community or development.
- **Explanation**: Active projects are more likely to have timely updates, fixes, and support.
  - **Elite**: Components are actively developed and maintained.
  - **High**: Components with slight dips in activity but still viable.
  - **Medium**: Components with noticeable inactivity or irregular updates.
  - **Low**: Inactive or abandoned components, posing a significant risk.

### 5. Version Risk
- **Definition**: Evaluates the risk based on the versions of components being used.
- **Explanation**: Using older or unsupported versions can lead to compatibility or security issues.
  - **Elite**: Latest, stable versions ensure maximum reliability and security.
  - **High**: Slightly outdated versions, still within support but needing updates.
  - **Medium**: Moderately outdated versions, with increasing risks of issues.
  - **Low**: Severely outdated versions, likely unsupported and insecure.
